**Narrative:** Giant golden gates with one of them wide up and destroyed, instead of a shiny gold its now dull. In the distance the destruction of the rest of the Heavens can be seen.

**Gameplay:** Start off with just one enemy for the player to easily finish off before finding a weapon for the rest of their journey. 



# 2. Courtyard

**Narrative:** An open field fill with benches, trees, statues and stone memoirs on the ground. Although after the invasion, trees are on fire and fallen on the ground, statues are broken, and destruction overall on the ground. 

**Gameplay:** Player encounters three grunt enemies and if the player looks around the area, they will find armor behind the only remaining statue to aid them. 



# 3. Training Grounds

**Narrative:** Training dummies and targets scour the open field with weapons used by heaven's inhabitants. Fire surrounds the area.

**Gameplay:** Many objects haven fallen onto the ground or are hanging from the outer building that allows the player to use parkour and attack enemies that are long-range attacking the player as well as advantage against on enemies staying on the ground. 






# 4. Great Hall 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fc91cd2-2c3a-46c8-886a-01367a9ac87e)

**Narrative:** A long narrow hall with stained glass filling the windows, some of these windows end up broken and there are trees coming in through those broken windows as well as heads of previous people of heaven littering the floor.

**Gameplay:** Four enemies flood the hall for the player to defeat and if the player goes through a certain door, they will find a bathroom for them to take a break and relax as well as finding as much ammo as they need. 



# 5. Chapel 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e56213b-5fa6-4eab-9a2c-8e027a7b812b)

**Narrative:** The place of worship. Books of the word of God scatter the area, pews stand there, some broken, others still intact and at the head of the church there is the podium with a statue of God and shattered glass behind it. Line shining showing there may still be hope.

**Gameplay:** Surprisingly, the area is safe, and in front of the statue the player with find a rocket launcher as their final weapon to make it through the rest of the level, but they have limited ammo. 



# 6. Spiral Tower

**Narrative:** The player is reaching the end, they are the last defense. The giant tower with nothing but a spiraling staircase up until the giant doors where the remaining people of Heaven are hidden and waiting for salvation. 

**Gameplay:** Test of the player's strength where they face off enemies of many types within each level they go up in the staircase. At the end where the doors are, they are met with the final boss to defeat. After defeat they go through the doors and the level ends for the player.
