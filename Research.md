Looking at references from shows, video games, and other sources has helped me develop my theme and overall concept that I would like to develop for my level as shown below. 

**Real world References:**

These images are how I want the major buildings to appear as in my level. Adding a sense of cleanliness and elegance before they are destroyed by the invading enemies. 

**In-Game References:** These are how I want some of the court fields and training grounds to appear as and I feel these games do them justice in how I want them to be modeled. The last ones form Outlast are the overall mood I want to set, muted type dark colors as a feeling of tragedy.
