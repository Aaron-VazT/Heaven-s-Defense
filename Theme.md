My overall thinking process was making a sort of opposite of my multiplayer level Starscream's Castle. My attempt will be creating a brighter environment to resemble a version of Heaven. Idea is to make the player feel that they are a hero or guardian defending the foundations of Heaven form the enemies found in the level. On certain areas I will attempt to block out certain actions like being able to get the heigh advantage in one area, or enveloping the player in darkness, leading up to a final boss location as their final test.

*What rooms do this area normally contain? -Meeting rooms, training grounds, higher beings room, gates of Heaven.

*Where is the toilet?

I would assume it's in the communal bathrooms that players can stop by and do their business. They need the janitor key though.

*What happened here recently?

Someone got careless and left the gates of Heaven opened, and now it is shrouded in evil and plague with destroyed artifacts, buildings and structures.

*What should the player be on the lookout for?

All the demons and creatures that are plaguing the foundations of Heaven, finding keys to get to the highest point where higher beings of Heaven are located as well as the final boss.

*Where is this place in the world?

The sky, high above the clouds
